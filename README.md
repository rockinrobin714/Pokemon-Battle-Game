# Pokemon-Battle-Game
This is a fun project I made that demos the Pokemon battle game on an old school gameboy.
Everything is made from CSS and Javascript.

I make no claim spoken or implied to the original game's copyright or intellectual property.

Pokemon is a registered trademark of Nintendo.

Here is a link to purchase the game (please note: I do not get any money from this app - it's made just for fun).
